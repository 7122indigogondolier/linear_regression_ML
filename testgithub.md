# Linear Regression ML Algorithm With Gradient Descent 

Assignment1.py is the program file for the first assignment in our AI class (CSCI 315). The program implements a linear regression algorithm which uses gradient descent to find the optimal values of regression parameters b0 and b1. 

The linear regression model is: 
	Y = b0 + (b1 * X)

## Getting Started 

**Libraries used:** 
1) numpy
2) pandas
3) matplotlib
